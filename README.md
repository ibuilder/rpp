# Relapse Prevention Plan

Outline for a relapse prevention plan for those of us who have the disease of addiction. Please feel free to use this as a template for your own relapse prevention plan (contribute or fork).

**[Chapter 3 - More about Alcoholism]**

**Cardinal Rules**

1.  Do NOT use mind altering substances
2.  Trust the friends in recovery who love you
3.  Pause, Pray, Proceed (PPP)

**Relapse Prevention Plan (Outline)**

1.  I will develop a positive support system and use it daily
2.  I will use prayer and meditation in my daily life
3.  I will be my own best support and give myself attention through the use of daily affirmations and awareness of any patterns of isolation and withdrawal
4.  I will read nightly in my AA/NA (Book) literature as part of my meditation practice.
5.  I will reach out to my peers who are in recovery to support and encourage each other on our journeys.
6.  I will engage in spirituality and fellowship with others in recovery.
7.  If I feel like I am in danger of relapsing, I will contact my support group (before I pick up/use).
8.  I'll cultivate my passions around exercising (physical), fellowship (connection), service, and passion (mental, eg: hobby, camping, hiking, fishing, horseback riding, snorkeling, traveling, etc.).
9.  I will seek out friendships with others in recovery including my home group, sponsor recommendations, to create a group for my own accountability, where I am honest in my communications and build healthy friendships.
10. Have associations with Rehabilitation facilities and similar recovery institutions.

I hope this helps you or a friend in recovery. Please pass it on to others who are interested; being nice is nice.

When all else fails, eight hugs a day is all the love a person needs.

Several resources were pulled from different organizations to compile this RPP outline.  Thank you to those persons who have helped compile the outline package.  Much gratitude is given to the Beach House Center for Recovery, Alcoholics Anonymous, and Therapy website which provided several of the PDF backup.
