# RelapsePreventionPlan

Outline for a relapse prevention plan for those of us who have the disease of addiction.

**[Chapter 3 - More about Alcoholism]**

**Cardinal Rules**

1.  Do NOT use mind altering substances
2.  Trust the friends in recovery who love you
3.  Pause, Pray, Proceed (PPP)

**Relapse Prevention Plan (Outline)**

1.  I will develop a positive support system and use it daily
2.  I will use prayer and meditation in my daily life
3.  I will be my own best support and give myself attention through the use of daily affirmations and awareness of any patterns of isolation and withdrawal
4.  I will read nightly in my AA/NA (Book) literature as part of my meditation practice.
5.  I will reach out to my peers who are in recovery to support and encourage each other on our journeys.
6.  I will engage in spirituality and fellowship with others in recovery.
7.  If I feel like I am in danger of relapsing, I will contact my support group (before I pick up/use).
8.  I'll cultivate my passions around exercising (physical), fellowship (connection), service, and passion (mental, eg: hobby, camping, hiking, fishing, horseback riding, snorkeling, traveling, etc.).
9.  I will seek out friendships with others in recovery including my home group, sponsor recommendations, to create a group for my own accountability, where I am honest in my communications and build healthy friendships.
10. Have associations with Rehabilitation facilities and similar recovery institutions.
